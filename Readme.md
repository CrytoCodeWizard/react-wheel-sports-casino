Roulette wheel specifications

Overview: Roulette wheel will be used to make predictions of a winning outcome between two teams. The wheel will be used during live YouTube broadcast.

Needs:
1.	All teams within NHL, NBA, NFL, MLB, MLS, NCAA football Division 1, NCAA men’s basketball Division 1.  
2.	All logos associated with each team. 
3.	I would like to be able to filter by sport (College Sports, NFL, NHL, MLB, NBA, & MLS) and select the two teams for the wheel to predict. I would like to designate which team is home and away. Please combine NCAA Football & NCAA Basketball under college sports.
4.	Auto assign red and black to teams once selected. 
5.	Auto assign green number 0 and 00 to either team to account for that occurrence. 
6.	Roulette wheel would need to record picks so that win/loss percentage can be recorded.
